# ~!Setup Required!~
# This requires a command block setup in a loaded chunk connected to a running clock:
# testfor @a[score_fishing_min=1] 
# (testing for everyone for a min. score of 1 (whatever you want the winning score to be))

# There needs to be a comparator running off the first command block that runs another commandblock containing:
# say @a[score_fishing_min=1] Wins the fishing Contest!
# (announce (anyone with a score equal to 1) Wins the fishing Contest!)
